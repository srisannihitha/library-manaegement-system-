A library database management system 
This project offers a platform for storing information about 
publishers, books, library branches, and patrons who are 
borrowing books. Additionally, a dynamic method of accessing 
data on issued and returned books, maintaining and updating data 
on all borrowed and returned books in real time. It is necessary to 
have a database used to store all these details in order to know the 
information regarding issued and returned books. Since this 
project can be used to obtain the a forementioned statement and 
update all issued and returned records in real time. The work of 
manually storing information and making mistakes is also 
decreased by this project and the resources used to plan and create 
this beneficial project.
This project's primary goal is to replace the manual entry and 
record-keeping system with an easy and straightforward database 
management system for the library. The primary goal of this 
project is to build a high-quality, dynamic management system 
that will use this database to store all the information about 
borrowed books.
